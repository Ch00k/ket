# ket

ket is a command-line tool, that makes interaction with
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) repositories easier.

You probably know [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) for
[GitHub](https://github.com) and/or
[lab](https://github.com/zaquestion/lab) for [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).
Well, ket is trying to accomplish the same goal, but for
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org).

ket is currently only capable of managing pull requests. More to come!

## Installation
```
$ pip install ket
```

## Configuration
In order to interact with a Bitbucket repository, ket needs to authenticate to
Bitbucket with a username and an API key. The username is usually your
Bitbucket username. For the API key you should use the so-called app password.
More on app passwords, and how to create them
[here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/app-passwords-828781300.html).

### Configuration file
ket tries to read its configuration from the file `$HOME/.config/ket`, which
must be formatted as follows:
```
[bitbucket]
username = Ch00k
api_key = <app_password>
```
